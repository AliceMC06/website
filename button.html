            <h1>PROXIMITY</h1>
            <p>For this design I had used lots of rectangles 
                to create a symbolic rock and roll effect 
                representing the music side of the festival, 
                this also represented the proximity aspect 
                of the poster. The colors in this design 
                worked well together as the writing was a 
                brighter color compared to the image and 
                the background. I also like how the hand 
                was holding on to a film strip including 
                the film aspect of the festival. The way 
                the title is front, and center makes it 
                easier for the viewer as well as having the 
                logo stand proudly on its own dedicating a 
                whole corner of the poster to it. All the 
                information, even though it's spread out 
                amongst the whole poster, is still very 
                easy to read and find the key points such 
                as the date and place as well as the web 
                link at the bottom. </p>

<h1>ALIGNMENT</h1>
            <p>My alignment poster for the CARP project is personally 
    my best design as I think it best represents what the 
    festival is about with the inclusion of a film strip 
    but showing the different types of arts shown inside. 
    It also had a lot of blank space, which I think was 
    really effective for the design as it let the text 
    boxes stand out, making the information clear. The 
    fonts were also adding a lot of detail to the poster 
    making it far more interesting to look at. 

    What I liked especially was how the film roll was 
    emerging out of the logo centered slightly in the 
    middle of the poster giving the illusion of a film 
    roll. </p>

        <div class="section-nine">
            <img src="CARP-project/contast-CARP-poster_converted.png" alt="picture of contrast poster">
<h1>CONTRAST</h1>
            <p>For my poster design I wanted to show contrast by 
    dividing the poster to two sides, one being light and 
    the other side being dark. By doing this I used the 
    logo as a template to divide a line for both sides, I 
    had also used other circular shapes with images found 
    from the internet of a music festival/concert setting 
    to help break up the two sides. On the dark red side I 
    had used black writing in an edgy pointed font as it 
    came across as very bold which was fitting for that 
    half whereases of the opposing side of the poster I had 
    used a softer font in the color light grey on top of a 
    white background to contrast the fierce bold side with 
    a calmer softer side. 

    I had laid out the text to be seen very clearly as 
    having the title in bold writing at the top of the 
    poster will be easily seen and readable whilst also 
    the center piece being the logo which will initially 
    draw you in if you're a previous fan of the true/false 
    film festival. 
    
    All the text written had been strategically placed as its spaced out enough to not make the poster too confusing but it's also a very simple design leaving a lot of blank space which purposely doesn't make the viewer feel overwhelmed. I especially like how the web link is wrapped around the image as it's easy to see but also tucked away so it's not so out of place. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-ten">
            <img src="CARP-project/Repetition-poster.png" alt="picture of repetition poster">
            
<h1>REPETITION</h1>
            <p>My design for this poster is very chaotic but still easy 
    to read considering throughout all my posters created 
    for the CARP project I had used the color pallet from 
    the logo. The checkered background with the use of 
    black and white images isn't too distracting from the 
    text but still represent the idea of repetition, 
    whereases the title specifically as it starts small 
    gradually getting bigger to the middle of the page 
    really jumps out at you which is rather eye catching. 

    The information for this poster is tidily placed all 
    together at the bottom left as the initial design of 
    the poster is very wild and has a lot going on so 
    having the information all closely together makes it a 
    lot easier for the viewer to read. I really think this 
    poster captures the emotion behind what type of 
    festival the true/false film festival is like which 
    sets the tone for people wanting to go. </p>
